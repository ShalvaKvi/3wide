I took a look at how Sergio Perez's qualifying pace has dropped off throughout the 2024 season. To make sure that the pace drop off wasn't due to a general drop off in
car performance, I decided to also plot his teammate's data, so that we could visually examine in car-related trends.
To achieve all of this, I used a 'dumbell' chart, where each end of the dumbell is either Sergio Perez or his teammate Max Verstappen, with the absolute 0 line being the optimal qualifying pace.

In this post I took a look at how the driver standings in the 2024 season looked after 10 rounds comapred to the previous season.
The idea was to highlight the changes and that occuered in the absolute rankings as well the proportion of points. I thought that using an alluvial plot for was a pretty neat way to achieve it.
